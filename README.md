# Adventure-Game

autopush.sh usage:

What this script does is rather than having to type:
```
% git add .
% git commit -m "comment message"
% git push
```

All you need to do is type:
```
% ./autopush.sh
```
where ```./``` means current directory and autopush.sh is an excutable

and then type your comment message, it pushes your commit for you automatically.

Sweet as!
